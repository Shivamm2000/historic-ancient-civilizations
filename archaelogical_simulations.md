## Virtual Reconstructions:
 - Site Reconstructions: Archaelogical sites can be virtually reconstructed in 3D, allowing researchers and the public to explore the layout and structures of ancient settlements.
 - Artifact Reconstructions: Virtual models of artifacts, such as tools, pottery, or buildings, can be created to study their design, use, and cultural significance.

## Landscape Modeling:
 - Geospatial Simulations: Simulating the changing landscapes over time, considering factors like climate, vegetation, and topography, helps researchers understand how these elements influence human activities.
